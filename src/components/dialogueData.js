It helps me relax in the moment, but afterward I sometimes question if it\'s really helping. I\'m not always proud of how I use alcohol to cope, and that makes me feel conflicted.'

      text: 'People often drink to get something from it. It helps them relax, socialize, adjust their attitude, improve their mood, and escape. The \"desired effects\" themselves are often positive. They are part of enjoying the good things in life and help deal with life\'s stressors. What desired effects do you try to get by drinking?'
    },
    { 
      speaker: 'You', 
      text: 'I think for me, it\'s mostly about unwinding and feeling more at ease. After a long day, having a drink helps me relax and shift out of work mode. It also makes social situations feel a little easier, like I can loosen up and be more present in the moment. Plus, sometimes it sparks creativity---like if I\'m writing or just reflecting on things, it helps me see things from a different angle.'

  // Screen 7: Alternative Ways
  7: [

If, for example, you tend to drink to reduce your stress and you\'re thinking about stopping or drinking less, how are you going to relax? People who don\'t develop other ways to relax may end up drinking heavily the next time they want to reduce their stress.'
    },
    { 
      speaker: 'You', 
      text: 'That\'s a good point. I guess I haven\'t thought too much about other ways to unwind. I do like going for walks or listening to music, and sometimes journaling helps me process things. Maybe I could be more intentional about those instead of just reaching for a drink automatically. I also think spending time with friends in ways that don\'t always involve drinking could help---like going to a caf√© instead of a bar.'

      speaker: 'EVA', 
      text: 'Here are your strategies as alternatives for getting what you want. Using them can reduce your risk for alcohol-related problems. It sounds like drinking helps you relax, feel present in the moment, and even tap into your creativity. Those are really valuable experiences. Have you noticed certain situations where you rely on alcohol to get those effects?'
    },
    { 
      speaker: 'You', 
      text: 'Yeah, mostly when I\'ve had a long day and just want to unwind. Sometimes, if I\'m trying to be creative---like writing or coming up with ideas---having a drink helps me feel more in the flow. I do listen to music a lot, especially when I\'m trying to get into a creative mindset. I haven\'t really thought about journaling, though---I guess that could help me get ideas flowing too.'
