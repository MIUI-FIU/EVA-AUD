# CAP 5109 Project 6: MIUI  
## Medium Fidelity Interactive Prototype

This README file provides instructions for evaluating our medium fidelity interactive wireframe prototype of the **Decision Balance Exercise** application.  
Please refer to the task list document for detailed task-based scenarios you will need to complete.

---

### Getting Started

1. Our prototype has been created using **[Balsamiq/Figma/Your chosen software]**.  
   You can access the prototype through the shared link: **[Insert your prototype link here]**

2. For each task, begin with the specified starting wireframe noted below.  
   You should be able to complete all tasks independently, without a facilitator.

### Starting Points for Tasks

| Task | Starting Wireframe |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Evaluate your drinking habits and begin the Decision Balance Exercise | "Welcome Screen" |
| 2. Introduce yourself to the SIA agent using your preferred input method | "SIA Introduction" |
| 3. List the positive aspects of drinking | "Pros of Drinking" |
| 4. List the negative aspects of drinking | "Cons of Drinking" |
| 5. Rank your selected pros and cons based on your priorities | "Ranking Screen" |
| 6. List the desired benefits you receive while drinking | "Drinking Benefits" |
| 7. List alternative activities to drinking | "Alternative Activities" |
| 8. Navigate throughout the Decision Balance Exercise | "Welcome Screen" (for navigation testing) |
| 9. View summaries and insights of your responses | "Summary Screen" |
| 10. Complete entire Decision Balance Exercise and exit | "Welcome Screen" (for full exercise completion) |

### UI Elements & Navigation Guide

- **SIA Agent Interface**  
  The Social Interaction Agent (SIA) appears throughout the exercise to guide you.  
  You can interact with it using **text input** or **selection buttons**.

- **Navigation Controls**  
  Use the **"Next"** and **"Back"** buttons at the bottom of each screen to move between sections.

- **Input Fields**  
  Text fields allow you to enter your personal responses.  
  Click inside any field to begin typing.

- **Ranking Interface**  
  On the ranking screen, you can **drag items to reorder them** or **use up/down arrows to adjust priority**.

- **Summary View**  
  This section collates all your responses and provides insights based on your inputs.

- **Exit Button**  
  Found on the final screen after completing all sections.

### Special Notes

- This prototype simulates a complete decision balance exercise but uses **predefined responses** for system-generated insights.
- The SIA agent's responses are simulated and **will not adapt to all possible user inputs** in this prototype.
