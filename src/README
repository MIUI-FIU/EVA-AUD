# CAP 5109 Project 6: MIUI
## Medium Fidelity Interactive Prototype

This README file provides instructions for evaluating our medium fidelity interactive wireframe prototype of the Decision Balance Exercise application. Please refer to the task list document for detailed task-based scenarios you will need to complete.

### Getting Started

1. Our prototype has been created using [Balsamiq/Figma/Your chosen software]. You can access the prototype through the shared link: [Insert your prototype link here]

2. For each task, begin with the specified starting wireframe noted below. You should be able to complete all tasks independently without a facilitator.

### Starting Points for Tasks

| Task | Starting Wireframe |
|------|-------------------|
| 1. Evaluate your drinking habits and begin the Decision Balance Exercise | Start with wireframe: "Welcome Screen" |
| 2. Introduce yourself to the SIA agent using your preferred input method | Start with wireframe: "SIA Introduction" |
| 3. List the positive aspects of drinking | Start with wireframe: "Pros of Drinking" |
| 4. List the negative aspects of drinking | Start with wireframe: "Cons of Drinking" |
| 5. Rank your selected pros and cons based on your priorities | Start with wireframe: "Ranking Screen" |
| 6. List the desired benefits you receive while drinking | Start with wireframe: "Drinking Benefits" |
| 7. List alternative activities to drinking | Start with wireframe: "Alternative Activities" |
| 8. Navigate throughout the Decision Balance Exercise | Start with wireframe: "Welcome Screen" (for navigation testing) |
| 9. View summaries and insights of your responses | Start with wireframe: "Summary Screen" |
| 10. Complete entire Decision Balance Exercise and exit | Start with wireframe: "Welcome Screen" (for full exercise completion) |

### UI Elements & Navigation Guide

- **SIA Agent Interface**: The Social Interaction Agent (SIA) appears throughout the exercise to guide you. You can interact with it using text input or selection buttons.
- **Navigation Controls**: Use the "Next" and "Back" buttons at the bottom of each screen to move between sections.
- **Input Fields**: Text fields allow you to enter your personal responses. Click inside any field to begin typing.
- **Ranking Interface**: On the ranking screen, you can [describe how the ranking works, e.g., "drag items to reorder them" or "use the up/down arrows to adjust priority"].
- **Summary View**: The summary section collates all your responses and provides insights based on your inputs.
- **Exit Button**: Found on the final screen after completing all sections.

### Special Notes

- This prototype simulates a complete decision balance exercise but uses predefined responses for system-generated insights.
- The SIA agent's responses are simulated and will not adapt to all possible user inputs in this prototype.
