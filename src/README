# CAP 5109 Project 6: eEVA AUD – Decision Balance Exercise (DBE)
## Medium-Fidelity Interactive Prototype – README

This README provides evaluation instructions for the medium-fidelity prototype of the **eEVA AUD application**, redesigned to support the **Decision Balance Exercise (DBE)** segment of the *Drinker's Check-Up (DCU)* alcohol intervention.

The primary goal of this redesign is to shift from a developer-oriented tool to a **user-centered, emotionally intelligent application**. The prototype leverages a **Socially Interactive Agent (SIA)** named EVA, designed to foster **rapport, trust, and emotional engagement** by guiding users through reflection on their alcohol use in a **non-judgmental, personalized environment**.

### Getting Started

1. Our prototype has been developed using **JavaScript** and related web technologies. You can access the prototype through the shared link: **[https://miui-fiu.github.io/EVA-AUD/](https://miui-fiu.github.io/EVA-AUD/)**

2. No installation or facilitator is required to begin evaluation. For each task, begin with the specified starting wireframe noted below. You should be able to complete all tasks independently.

### Starting Points for Tasks

Below are the tasks for evaluating our prototype, along with their starting points:

| Task | Starting Point |
|------|-------------------|
| 1. **Navigating throughout the Decision Balance Exercise:** Navigate to corresponding sections of the Decision Balance Exercise to complete the exercise. | Start with the home screen of the application |
| 2. **Viewing Summaries and Insights:** Review the summary of your responses and insights the system provides. | Navigate to the summary section near the end of the exercise |
| 3. **Complete entire Decision Balance Exercise and exit:** Finish the entire Decision Balance Exercise and exit the application. | Begin from the home screen and complete the full exercise |
| 4. **Evaluate your drinking habits:** Find the section where you can begin this process and start. | Start with the home screen |
| 5. **Interact with the SIA:** After EVA introduces itself, introduce yourself to the agent using your preferred input method. | EVA Introduction screen |
| 6. **List positive aspects of drinking:** Locate where you can input these details and complete the task. | Pros of Drinking section |
| 7. **List negative aspects of drinking:** Locate where you can input these details and complete this task. | Cons of Drinking section |
| 8. **Rank pros and cons of drinking:** Locate the pros and cons elements and figure out how to rank based on your priorities. | Prioritization of Drinking |
| 9. **List desired benefits from drinking:** Input the benefits you receive while drinking. | Alternatives (Getting What You Want) section |
| 10. **List alternative activities to drinking:** Input your alternative activities. | Alternatives (Get Where You Want To Go) section |

### UI Elements & Navigation Guide

- **EVA: Socially Interactive Agent**: EVA acts as a virtual facilitator throughout the exercise, using techniques such as empathetic introductions, emotional mirroring, gentle reassurance, and active listening.
- **Navigation Controls**: Use the "Next" and "Back" buttons at the bottom of each screen to progress through or revisit parts of the exercise.
- **Interaction Modes**: You can enter responses using typed input or selection-based interfaces where applicable.
- **Input Fields**: Text fields allow you to enter your personal responses. Click inside any field to begin typing.
- **Ranking Interface**: Items in the pros and cons list can be reordered using drag-and-drop or arrow buttons to indicate their importance to you.
- **Summary View**: Toward the end of the DBE, EVA presents a personalized overview of your reflections, helping reinforce behavior insights and readiness for change.
- **Exit Button**: Found on the final screen after completing all sections.

### Prototype Considerations

- This prototype is a medium-fidelity simulation: EVA's responses are scripted for testing purposes and do not yet use adaptive AI.
- Insights and dialogue shown are derived from predefined content modeled after real-world behavioral interventions.
- This experience is part of a broader reimagining of the eEVA platform, moving from static assessments to engaging, emotionally aware interventions.
